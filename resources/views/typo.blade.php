                                <p>Who are you, my warranty?! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Is that a cooking show? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>
                                <p>Bender?! You stole the atom. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Soothe us with sweet lies. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p>
                                <p>Can we have Bender Burgers again? Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Fatal. Bender, you risked your life to save me! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p>
                                <p>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Soothe us with sweet lies. Say it in Russian!</p>
                                <p>We're also Santa Claus! I never loved you. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>
                                <p>Okay, I like a challenge. Ow, my spirit! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! I had more, but you go ahead.</p>
                                <p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
                                <p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Leela's gonna kill me. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
                                <p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>
                                <p>I love you, buddy! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Actually, that's still true. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
                                <p>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! With gusto.</p>
                                <p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… But I've never been to the moon! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p>

                                <p>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
